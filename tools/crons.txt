Make sure you edit the location to your servers files...

To install these crons. In your servers ftp go to the directory "/var/spool/cron/crontabs" and then copy/paste the cron jobs you want to use which would be restarter.pl and for example  time sync into the file which is usually your User-name. For example for the user root the file would be called root, and for dayzaccount the file would be called dayzaccount, if it isn't there then make a blank file called the login you use and paste in the crons you wish to use remembering to change the location on the cron to your server folder.
